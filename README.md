## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Utilizing a drink database api, the app pulls info from the api based on the user input. There are several hundred different drinks as well as non-alcoholic drink options.

API's used:

## Optimizations

Ideally this app would been mobile responsive, however, since it was only to be used once on an Ipad it works great on that platform. Should this backend be resued with a different skin, I would add mobile responsiveness. Additionally, I wanted to add a button to choose non-alcoholic drinks as well as a random button in case the user didn't know what they wanted.

## Lessons Learned:

This app challenges me create a carousel based display in an afternoon before a party. It was a rush turn around. But more importanly it worked and was a hit! I even learned how to make a mint julup while in costume. :)
